# Fundraising<a name="fundraising"></a>

Model fundraising is an important part of our fundraising effort. The main beauty of this being it can get donations from people outside of John Snow and Durham. 

We want you to have fun with this, so please don't feel pressured. Any strange and weird idea can be welcomed.

### How much do I need to raise?

Due to the growth of the fashion show this year we are asking models to aim to **Â£100** each.

### When do I need to do this by?

Ermm, whenever suits you really. We may as you to move some events around but can cross that bridge if it happens. Any month-long type things can happen in June and finish after the main shows if needed.

### Do I have to do this individually?

No! You can do it individually, in pairs, as a group or a mixture of any of them.

### Can JSCFS Exec help?

We can! If you have an idea that you are struggling to get off the ground or need help with planning/sponsorship please get in touch.

### How do I collect money?

This can either be collected through our [Just Giving](https://www.justgiving.com/page/jscfs2024/) page or you can set up your own. If you are setting up your own please make sure we are aware so we can include your hard work in our final total.

### Should I run my idea past the exec?

Please do! Use [this form](https://forms.gle/pbisfe135vuDEjsS8/) to submit what are you are going to be doing.

### Have you got any examples/ideas?

- [500k in May](https://www.instagram.com/jscfs_500kinmay/)
- Running a charity Vinted shop
- Charity darts league
- 24 hour matches
- Pestering friends and family

## Should I update my Facebook profile picture?

Shortly we will be asking you to do this. We are just waiting for February pay day as we feel we'll get more people donating. Stay tuned for more info.
