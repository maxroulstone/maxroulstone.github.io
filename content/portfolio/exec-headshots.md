    text: "<p>The first big media post of the year, as ever falls to the Exec Headshots. We knew we wanted to increase the professionalism and artistic vision this year and this was our first trial run.</p><p>Our Media and Photography teams got to work envisioning what would be possible in the cold dark winters of the Northern city of Durham. We had to ensure we produced a high quality end result that fit the aesthetic we were aiming for, whilst fitting into what was realistic.</p> <p>We settled on a 'grunge,' 'streetwear' style and found a nearby carpark as our backdrop. The shoots took place over 3 days, in which the incredibly talented <a href=https://frogallic.photography>Louis De Robert Hautequere</a>, <a href=https://lucamartin.myportfolio.com/>Luca Martin</a> and Pip Gathercole worked on bringing the vision to life."

    text: "<p>Utilising the artistic and storytelling potential of group shots allowed us to give a more insightful look into how the fashion show is structured and how each element of the show comes together. Individual shots gave another opportunity for the incredibly talented Exec to express themselves, giving viewers another look into the people running the show.</p><p>Finally, after successful shoots we turned to the editting of the shots. Louis and Luca took to their laptops and were able to give the shots the aesthetic we desired. The talented media team then applied the finishing touches, overlaying graphics to give a a professional end product.</p>"
